## Research Interests

Our group investigate all aspects of visual processing, including motion processing, spatial vision, temporal vision, colour perception, binocular vision, ocular motor control, neural plasticity and normal and abnormal visual development. There is also a clinical focus on understanding and treating disorders of vision, such as amblyopia and macular degeneration.
